# MusicTool MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Build a minimal collection manager with Gap Analysis using API-first design + Streamlit UI

**Architecture**: Backend API ‚Üí Streamlit Frontend
**Primary Workflow**: Identify vinyl tracks missing from digital collection

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Layer (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [x] Set up Python environment with dependencies
  - `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`
  - `lxml` for NML parsing, `fuzzywuzzy` for matching
- [x] Create proper folder structure following guidelines
- [x] Set up environment configuration

### 1.2 Data Parsers (Core API Layer)
- [x] **NML Parser** (`src/python/core/nml_parser.py`)
  - Parse Traktor collection XML
  - Extract: Artist, Title, Album, Genre, File Path, BPM, Key, Filesize, Filetype
  - Return structured pandas DataFrame
  - ‚úÖ **TESTED**: Successfully parsed 3,003 tracks from real collection
  - ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**: Added filesize and filetype extraction
  - üêõ **KNOWN ISSUE**: Filesize values seem too low (~60MB total) - needs investigation
  
- [x] **Discogs CSV Parser** (`src/python/core/discogs_parser.py`)
  - Parse Discogs collection export
  - Extract: Artist, Release Title, Catalog Number, Label, Format, Year
  - Handle inconsistencies in catalog numbers/formats
  - ‚úÖ **TESTED**: Successfully parsed 598 releases from real collection
  - ‚úÖ **INSIGHTS**: 98% DnB collection, 345 artists, 229 labels, primarily 12" format

- [x] **Discogs API Client** (`src/python/core/discogs_client.py`)
  - Rate-limited API calls (60 requests/minute)
  - Fetch release details by ID
  - Cache responses locally (JSON files)
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - ‚úÖ **TESTED**: Successfully fetched 3 releases with full tracklist data
  - ‚úÖ **FEATURES**: Rate limiting, caching, batch processing, tracklist extraction

- [x] **Collection Expander** (`src/python/core/collection_expander.py`)
  - **Core Function**: Transform Discogs releases ‚Üí individual tracks
  - For each release in CSV: API call ‚Üí get tracklist ‚Üí create track records
  - Merge release metadata (label, year, format) with track data
  - Handle multi-disc releases, bonus tracks, variations
  - Progress tracking for bulk expansion operations
  - ‚úÖ **TESTED**: Successfully expanded 5 releases ‚Üí 23 tracks
  - ‚úÖ **FEATURES**: SQLite persistence, rate limiting, comprehensive metadata

- [ ] **Collection Storage** (`src/python/core/collection_storage.py`)
  - Persist expanded physical collection (SQLite or Parquet)
  - Track expansion timestamps and source CSV checksums
  - Smart incremental updates (only expand new/changed releases)
  - Export/import functionality for backup/sharing

### 1.3 Data Models
- [ ] Define unified track/release data structures
- [ ] Create data validation and cleaning utilities

---

## Phase 2: Gap Analysis Engine (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Track Matching Algorithm
- [x] **Fuzzy Matching Logic** (`src/python/core/gap_analyzer.py`)
  - Artist name normalization (case, punctuation, "The", etc.)
  - Title matching with confidence scores
  - Album/release correlation
  - Handle various edge cases
  - ‚úÖ **TESTED**: 23 physical vs 3,003 digital tracks analyzed successfully

### 2.2 Gap Analysis Core
- [x] **Gap Finder** (`src/python/core/gap_analyzer.py`)
  - Load NML tracks (digital collection)
  - Load persisted physical collection (expanded vinyl tracks)
  - Execute matching algorithm between the two datasets
  - Generate gap analysis report with confidence scores
  - ‚úÖ **RESULTS**: Found 5/23 matches (21.7%), identified 18 gaps (78.3%)
  - ‚úÖ **INSIGHTS**: Entire "Essence" LP missing, perfect matches on exact titles

### 2.3 Caching & Performance
- [ ] Local cache for Discogs API responses
- [ ] Persisted physical collection database (avoid re-expansion)
- [ ] Incremental updates (only process new releases)
- [ ] Progress tracking for long-running operations

## Phase 3: Streamlit UI (Week 3-4) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### 3.1 Main Application Structure
- [x] **App Layout** (`src/python/ui/streamlit_app.py`)
  - Sidebar navigation with emoji icons
  - Data loading with caching
