3. **Click "Start Expansion"**
4. **Monitor Progress** in real-time

#### 3. What Happens:
- MusicTool queries Discogs API for each release
- Extracts complete tracklist information
- Adds detailed metadata (label, catalog number, year)
- Stores everything in local database

#### 4. Progress Monitoring:
- **Real-time Updates**: See current processing status
- **Success/Error Counts**: Track expansion accuracy
- **ETA**: Estimated completion time
- **Batch Progress**: Current batch status

### Expected Results:
- **Input**: 594 releases (example)
- **Output**: 1,791+ individual tracks
- **Success Rate**: 95-98% typical
- **Processing Time**: 2-3 tracks per second

## üîç Gap Analysis

Gap Analysis helps you identify tracks in your physical collection that are missing from your digital library.

### Configuration Options:

#### Confidence Threshold (50-95%)
- **85% (Recommended)**: Good balance of accuracy and sensitivity
- **90%+**: Very strict, fewer false positives
- **80% or lower**: More sensitive, may include similar tracks

#### Analysis Modes:
- **üöÄ Fast Sample (100 tracks)**: Quick preview for testing
- **üîç Complete Analysis**: Process your entire collection
- **üéØ Custom Range**: Specify exact number of tracks

### How It Works:

#### 1. Intelligent Matching
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Handles variations in track names
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Considers artist, title, and combined similarity
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses indexing for speed

#### 2. Confidence Scoring
- **Title Weight**: 60% (most important)
- **Artist Weight**: 30% 
- **Combined Weight**: 10%
- **Final Score**: Weighted average of all factors

#### 3. Match Categories:
- **Found** (‚â• threshold): Track exists in digital collection
- **Missing** (< threshold): Track not found or low confidence match

### Reading Results:

#### Summary Metrics:
- **Found Percentage**: How much of your physical collection is digitized
- **Missing Count**: Tracks you might want to acquire digitally
- **Average Confidence**: Overall matching quality

#### Detailed Results:
- **Color Coding**: Green = found, Red = missing
- **Confidence Scores**: Numerical similarity ratings
- **Match Details**: See exactly which digital track matched

### Action Items:
1. **Review Missing Tracks**: Identify acquisition targets
2. **Check Low Confidence Matches**: Verify accuracy
3. **Export Results**: Download for offline review
4. **Prioritize by Album**: Focus on complete album gaps

## üîÑ Duplicate Finder

The Duplicate Finder helps clean up your digital collection by identifying potential duplicate tracks.

### Detection Methods:

#### üéµ Artist + Title (Recommended)
- **Best For**: Finding true duplicates
- **How It Works**: Compares both artist and title with fuzzy matching
- **Accuracy**: Highest precision, lowest false positives

#### üéº Title Only
- **Best For**: Finding covers, remixes, different versions
- **How It Works**: Focuses only on track titles
- **Use Case**: Identify multiple versions of the same song

#### üìÅ Filename Similarity
- **Best For**: Files with similar naming patterns
- **How It Works**: Compares actual file names
- **Use Case**: Detect duplicate downloads with different metadata

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Duration + Title
- **Best For**: Identical recordings with different metadata
- **How It Works**: Combines title matching with track length
- **Use Case**: Same recording with different artist credits

### Configuration:

#### Similarity Threshold (60-95%)
- **85% (Recommended)**: Good balance for most collections
- **90%+**: Very strict, only obvious duplicates
- **80% or lower**: More sensitive, requires careful review

### Understanding Results:

#### Duplicate Groups:
- Each group contains potentially duplicate tracks
- **Original**: First track found (reference)
- **Duplicates**: Similar tracks with confidence scores

#### Quality Analysis:
- **File Size**: Larger files typically higher quality
- **Bitrate**: Higher bitrate = better audio quality
- **Format**: Lossless formats (FLAC) vs. compressed (MP3)

#### Space Savings:
- **Potential MB Saved**: Storage you could reclaim
- **Largest Groups**: Most duplicated tracks
- **Format Distribution**: Which file types have duplicates

### Recommended Workflow:

#### 1. Start Conservative
- Use 85-90% threshold initially
- Review results carefully
- Verify before deleting anything

#### 2. Quality Priority
- Keep highest bitrate versions
- Prefer lossless formats (FLAC > WAV > MP3)
- Consider file size as quality indicator

#### 3. Manual Review
- **Export Results**: Download duplicate lists
- **Check Samples**: Listen to suspected duplicates
- **Batch Process**: Handle duplicates systematically

#### 4. Safety First
- **Backup Important Files**: Before deletion
- **Test on Small Sets**: Start with obvious duplicates
- **Keep Originals**: If unsure, keep both copies

### Expansion Tool
**Purpose**: Convert Discogs releases into individual tracks

#### Settings:
- **Max Releases**: Control batch size (start small)

#### Best Practices:
- Start with 10-20 releases to test
- Monitor API rate limits (60 requests/minute)
- Run expansion during off-peak hours
- Check error logs for problematic releases

### Configuration Status
**Purpose**: Verify system setup and health

#### Checks:
- **API Key Status**: Verify Discogs connectivity
- **Database Health**: Confirm data integrity

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "No API Key Found"
- **Solution**: Check `.env` file exists with correct key
