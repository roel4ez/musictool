## ✨ Overview ✨

All of our impactful decisions can be found here in the form of ADRs. 📋

The acronym ADR is typically used for **A**rchitecture **D**ecision **R**ecords. 🏗️

We use the acronym more broadly and use it for decisions relating to architecture,
design, technology choices and other decisions that impact how we build the solution. 🔧⚙️

When creating an ADR, please use the following naming convention for the files: 📝

> YYYY-MM-DD - [Brief Description] 📅
> For Example and ADR created on 2022.09.01 would be named
> _2022-09-01-example.md_ 📄

All related diagrams should be stored in the `.attachments`
folder in the root of [`docs`](..) and should have unique, yet identifiable names
referenced in the `adr` content. 📊🗂️

> ADR Name: 2022-09-01 - Example ADR with 2 diags: 📋<br/><br/>
> _2022-09-01-diag01.png_ 🖼️<br/>
> _2022-09-01-diag02.gif_ 🎬<br/>

<br/>If a tool like `PUML` is used, make use of the `.diags` folder in the root
of project to store the `PUML` files and ensure that the resulting images are
exported to the `.attachments` folder in the root of [`docs`](..). 🛠️📐
