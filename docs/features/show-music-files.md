# Show list of music files, including metadata

This feature will allow the user to see a list of all music files in their collection, along with relevant metadata such as artist, album, and track length. The user will be able to sort and filter the list based on different criteria.
The list will be generated from the Traktor Pro 3 library, available as NML file, which will be used as the primary source of music.
