# Implementation Plan for List Music Files Feature

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement the feature for visualizing a list of music files with metadata based on the Traktor Pro 3 library (NML file).

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Framework**: Electron
- **Libraries**:
  - xml2js or fast-xml-parser (for parsing NML)
  - React (for UI components)
  - Electron Store (for user preferences)
  - Material-UI or Chakra UI (for UI framework)
  - electron-builder (for packaging)
  - react-table or ag-Grid (for data display)
  - electron-updater (for application updates)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize a new Electron project with TypeScript
- [x] Set up React within Electron
- [x] Configure build system (webpack/vite)
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Set up linting and formatting

### 2. NML Parser Development
- [ ] Create utility to read NML file
- [ ] Develop parser to extract metadata from XML
- [ ] Map XML data to application data model
- [ ] Implement caching for performance
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed XML

### 3. UI Development for Music List
- [ ] Design table layout for music files
- [ ] Implement UI components for metadata display
- [ ] Create columns for all required metadata:
  - [ ] Artist
  - [ ] Title
  - [ ] Label
  - [ ] Year
  - [ ] Genre
  - [ ] Album
  - [ ] Comment
  - [ ] BPM
  - [ ] Track length
  - [ ] File path
- [ ] Add sorting functionality
- [ ] Implement filtering options

### 4. Application Features
- [ ] Add file selection dialog for choosing NML file
- [ ] Implement data refresh functionality
- [ ] Create settings page for user preferences
- [ ] Add column visibility toggles
- [ ] Implement persistent settings

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large collections
- [ ] Implement virtualized scrolling
- [ ] Add loading indicators for large files
- [ ] Optimize memory usage

### 6. Testing and QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for parser
- [ ] Test with various NML file sizes
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows and macOS)

### 7. Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] Configure electron-builder
- [ ] Create installers for Windows and macOS
- [ ] Set up auto-update system
- [ ] Prepare documentation

## Next Steps After Initial Implementation
- Integration with future features (Discogs metadata, editing capabilities)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- UI enhancements and themes
- Performance optimizations for very large collections
