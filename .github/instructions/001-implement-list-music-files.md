# Implementation Plan for List Music Files

Visualize list of music files, with a limited set of metadata, based on the Traktor Pro 3 library, available as NML file.

Metadata will include:
- Artist
- Title
- Label
- Year
- Genre
- Album
- Comment
- BPM
- Track length
- File path

## Questions:

- which programming language should be used?
- which framework should be used?
- which libraries should be used?

## Requirements

- Should have UI to display the list of music files
- Should run on Windows and MacOS
